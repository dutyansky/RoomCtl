RoomCtl
=======
Originally a private project, something quick & least-resistance.
Custom CondCtl device for peripherals control (ventilation notably)
 and Arduino board for additional peripherals (servos for blinds, AC unit, etc.)
 For both AT-like serial command interface is used.

See RoomCtl.ino for Arduino sketch, condsrv.py for overall high-level control and web interface
